/**
 * mutation — does each new suite actually test its feature, or only its own scaffolding?
 *
 * Twelve suites were added in one day, each reviewed by the same person who wrote it. The
 * outbound-queue episode showed what that can produce: four green commits over a feature that
 * did not work, because every test told the code what it wanted to hear.
 *
 * The check is blunt and therefore hard to fool — DELETE THE FEATURE and confirm the suite
 * notices. A suite that still passes with its feature removed is asserting on scaffolding.
 *
 * SAFETY. These mutations edit the LIVE plugin (adapter.py, the sidecar). Every target is
 * backed up before the edit, restored in a finally, restored again on SIGINT/SIGTERM/uncaught,
 * and verified by hash at the end. If the hash check fails the run says so loudly rather than
 * leaving a mutated plugin behind.
 *
 * Run: npm run mutation            (all)
 *      npm run mutation -- stt     (one, by substring)
